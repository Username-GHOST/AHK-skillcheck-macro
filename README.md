Any public version updates will be published here
I do already have paid versions for it which can detect what key to press for skill check it beats skillchecks that change key every time 

Script works by setting up color HEX after 0x(EDIT HERE) for moving color and for non moving color so that when moving color goes on top of the non moving color the script will execute ur chosen key to beat the skill check.
I made this script for myself to make my life easier to play gta5 roleplay servers where they added skillchecks when fishing or mining rocks
I havent tested it on dead by daylight but it should work on there too since i saw a lot of forums strugling to make a script like this and when i found one github link where a guy claimed he made it his code and exe file was sus to me to launch so instead i make this AHK easy script (Took me 8 hours to make it including adding GUI and i can say im pretty new to ahk stuff since its the first script i wrote in ahk.
